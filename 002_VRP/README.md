# Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)

The **Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)** aims to compute optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles that must serve a set of customers with known demands.

### Objective
Minimize total travel distance (or time).

### Constraints
- Vehicles start and end at a depot
- Each customer must be visited exactly once
- Demand on each route cannot exceed vehicle capacity
